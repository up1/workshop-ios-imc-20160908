## About the Tutorial
The tutorial will help you write your first TDD app in Swift by building a FizzBuzz game for iOS. We’ll build it up step-by-step and learn about different aspects of building a mobile app.

#### Who is the tutorial for?
If you’re new to iOS development, Swift or testing in iOS then you should learn a lot from this tutorial.

This tutorial does assume prior programming experience. Specifically you should have an understanding of programming concepts like variables, if statements, functions, and classes.

If you’re a complete beginner to programming in general, you might find a lot of basic programming concepts are skipped over, and for a more gentle start you might want to start elsewhere. I’m a big fan of the Ruby course on Codecademy.
